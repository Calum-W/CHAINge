## About
This project was built in five days by a team of six during Week 9 of Makers' Academy. The members were [Charles Emery](https://github.com/charlesemery15), [Joe Pike](https://github.com/joepike), [Valentina Romeo](https://github.com/Ciancion), [Nikolaos Sakellarios](https://github.com/lunaticnick), [Cal Widdall](https://github.com/Calum-W) and [Ellie Wintram](https://github.com/ewintram).

At the start of the project, we were familiar with the concept of blockchains, but knew nothing of how they were implemented or the languages used. Our main challenge was learning Solidity (the language used to write the contract), Truffle (Solidity's testing framework), and connecting it to a Javascript-based front-end.

## Tech Stack
